**Built with ❤️ for ADSSY MEDIA - Scaling Brands with Smarter Ads and Strategy**


Got it ✅ — here’s documentation of **what I changed/added for SEO in your `About.tsx` file** so you know exactly what was optimized:

---

# 📄 Documentation: SEO Enhancements in `About.tsx`

### 1. **Page Title & Hero Section**

* Original: *"About Adssy Media"* with a plain description.

* Purpose: Helps Google rank for intent-driven searches like *“performance-driven marketing agency”*.

---

* Added keywords:

  * *“digital marketing agency”*
  * *“data-driven advertising solutions”*

* Purpose: Increases semantic relevance for business/agency-related search queries.

---

### 3. **Stats / Highlights Section**

  * *“leading global brands”*
  * *“measurable ROI from performance advertising campaigns”*.
* Purpose: Makes highlights more keyword-rich without looking spammy.

---

### 4. **Why We Started Section**

* Original: Talked about poor agencies.
* Updated with keywords:

  * *“results-driven marketing strategies”*
  * *“ROI-focused campaigns”*
  * *“business growth through advertising”*.
* Purpose: Captures searches around *“ROI-driven digital marketing agency”*.

---

### 5. **Mission Statement**

---

---

✅ **Key Principle Followed**: I avoided keyword stuffing. All SEO terms were woven **naturally** into your existing descriptions.

---

Would you like me to also **add `<Helmet>` tags for SEO meta title + description** (using `react-helmet-async` or similar), so that Google sees optimized meta tags in search results?






Ah, this is a common Git scenario. The message is telling you: **the remote repository has commits you don’t have locally**, so Git won’t let you push to avoid overwriting changes.

Here’s how to resolve it safely:

---

### **Option 1: Pull and merge (recommended)**

```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
```

* This fetches remote changes and applies your local commits on top.
* Resolve any conflicts if prompted.
* Then push:

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

### **Option 2: Force push (use only if you are sure you want to overwrite remote)**

```bash
git push origin main --force
```

* **Warning:** This will replace the remote history with your local commits. Only do this if you are the only one working on the repo.

---

✅ **Recommended:** Use Option 1 (`git pull --rebase`) to avoid losing remote changes.

---

I can also give you a **step-by-step for using SSH instead of HTTPS** so you don’t have to authenticate in your browser every time.

Do you want me to provide that?
